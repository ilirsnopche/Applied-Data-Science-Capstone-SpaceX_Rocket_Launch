# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX_Rocket_Launch
This  project gives an idea of what data scientists do in real life when working with real datasets. We will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup competing with SpaceX, whose goal is to create a machine learning pipeline to predict the landing outcome of the first stage of a rocket launch.
